<p class="p1">Build a website for FRREEEEEEEEE on macOS</p>
<p class="p2">first, open textedit, then use the tools and build the view of your website, use the fonts, colours, and text sizes to build your website view (like, what its goanna look like in the browser) then save it and change the file type extension from „.rtf” to „.html” in finder then open it now as a html file and delete all of the „&lt;p&gt;”’s and other bits to make it exatly like it was when it was an rtf file, then save it again, and after that go to it in finder and double click on it, select „open with” and open it with a browser, this method only works if you don’t have any images in your html file. NOTE: you will have to select open with to open your website. to allow a web address to open it, you will need to host it onto a web server. getting your own server costs lots of money but if you search in „free web hosting” in your browser some companys will let you use their sever for free.</p>
